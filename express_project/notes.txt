Express used for:
-easy API setup
-less overhead, fewer props to setup - instatiate express app and listen for req on port
-Express is a framework for Node.js
-Server-sided app

client needs to send HTTP req to server.
code on client side makes req to express server side application.
server side application runs logic and will send back a response to client side application.

In package.json - changing type to "modules" - remember to add .mjs to files so you can use ES6 modules and syntax for import/export

query params:
1. can be used on client side to send data across different pages (eg. passing state)
2. send from client side to server side to add additional data to req that usually isn't added to HTTP req body (eg. when using GET request you could filter or sort server response) 
* should not be used to send sensitive data (eg. passwords) - use req body instead

POST req:
data sent from client to server is sent as req.body/payload
server then does things like validation and parsing before applying logic/sending to db/file storage etc.
returns 201 status if req successful and new resource was created.
*need to use middleware to parse JSON data from req.body so express can use data - middleware function should be called/invoked before the req is made
*middleware functions have access to req +  res objects and (if) there is the next middleware function in the apps req,res cycle
--> for middleware app.use()

PUT, PATCH req:
used to update existing resources
-PATCH - partial update
-PUT - replace entire resource --> so you need to include all fields in req.body, even parts that aren't being updated since the PUT request is overwriting the resource (or they will be null)

DELETE req:
used to delete resources
